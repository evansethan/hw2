By creating a Triangle class, the code is more object-oriented, making it easily reusable. Also, when encapsulated by a class, data about the triangle can now be only accessed by the class's functions, preventing invalid variable alterations and making the program more robust. Also, the main() function is now more readable, abstracting away all of the "how" to the Triangle class and it's methods.
