⚫ One of the above slides referred to a function median, that takes the median
of a vector of doubles.
⚫ Part 1. Write the median function using the sort function in the algorithm
header.
⚫ Part 2. Write the median function using the partial_sort function in the
algorithm header. Is this more efficient? Why do you think that? (You can give
an intuitive or practical answer without precise mathematical analysis)
⚫ Part 3. Write the median function using the nth_element function header.
Do you think this is even more efficient? Why?
⚫ Part 4 - Extra credit: Write a template function that can find the median
of a vector of any appropriate type.
⚫ Although we haven’t discussed writing our own template functions yet,
looking at the template function for squaring from last week’s slides
⚫ You can use any of the underlying algorithms from parts 1 to 3 above
⚫ More extra credit. If there are an even number of elements, use the
average of the middle 2 element
